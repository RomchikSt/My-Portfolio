## How to Use

1. Adding Items: In the input labeled "What do you need for your üòç trip?", specify the quantity and the name of the item you want to pack. Click on the ADD ITEM button to include it in the list.
2. Marking Items: Items on the list have a checkbox. Checking the box will strike through the item, indicating it's packed.
3. Deleting Items: Each item has a red 'X' next to its name. Clicking this will remove the item from the list.
4. Clearing the List: To erase all items from the list, click the Clear list button.
5. Sorting Options: There are several ways to organize your list:

- sort by input order: Arranges items based on when they were added.
- sort by description: Organizes items alphabetically.
- sort by packed status: Prioritizes items that aren't checked off yet. This means items you still need to pack appear at the top of the list.

6. Statistics: At the bottom, you'll find a summary showing the number of items packed and the total number of items on the list.
