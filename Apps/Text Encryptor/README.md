## Install and Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## How to Use

1. Type or paste the text you want to encrypt or decrypt into the `Message` textarea.
2. Select the desired cipher method from the dropdown list.
3. Click on the `Encrypt` button to get the encrypted text, or `Decrypt` to decrypt the provided text.
4. View the result in the `Result` textarea.

## Cipher Methods

- **Caesar** - Shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Reverse** - Reverses the order of characters in the text.
- **Substitution** - Uses a shuffled version of the alphabet to replace each character in the text.
- **Atbash** - Replaces each character in the text with its opposite in the alphabet. For instance, 'A' becomes 'Z', and 'Z' becomes 'A'.
- **Vigenère** - Uses a keyword to encrypt the text in a way that is harder to decrypt without knowing the keyword.
